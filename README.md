# README 

For [leechblock](https://github.com/proginosko/LeechBlockNG/). 

## Blocklist 1 

> `mimuki.net/block/1`

Blocks social media I've found myself tempted to use in unhealthy ways

### Manual config 

- Time periods to block: `0000-2400` (all day)
- [x] Close tab instead of blocking page
- [x] Allow temporary override for these sites
- [ ] Allow temporary override during lockdown

## Blocklist 2 

> `mimuki.net/block/2`

Blocks every website, minus those "you're being redirected, but it's not a new webpage" pages. Useful for when you need a nudge to computer less. And websites that I need to access in an emergency, because forcing loved ones to change platform is not cool, even if it's a bad platform.

### Manual config 

(todo: make this accurate)
